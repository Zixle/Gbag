# Gbag

This is a implementation of generic bag data structure in C. The bag allows dynamic storage of items of various types, supporting custom comparison and string conversion functions for each item. It’s designed to be flexible and efficient, making it ideal for learning and experimentation with data structures in C.

You can: 
  • Add, remove, and retrieve items.
	•	Check if an item exists or if the bag is empty.
	•	Compare bags for equality.
	•	Convert the bag to a string representation for debugging or display.
